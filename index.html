				For most of our history, human technology consisted of our brains, fire, and sharp sticks.
				While fire and sharp sticks became power plants and nuclear weapons, the biggest upgrade
				has happened to our brains. Since the 1960's, the power of our brain machines has kept growing
				exponentially, allowing computers to get smaller and more powerful at the same time.
				But this process is about to meet its physical limits. Computer parts are approaching
				the size of an atom. To understand why this is a problem, we have to clear up some basics.
				A computer is made up of very simple components doing very simple things. Representing data, the
				means of processing it, and control mechanisms. Computer chips contain modules, which contain
				logic gates, which contain transistors. A transistor is the simplest form of a data processor
				in computers, basically a switch that can either block, or open the way for information coming through.
				This information is made up of bits which can be set to either 0 or 1. Combinations of several bits
				are used to represent more complex information. Transistors are combined to create logic gates which
				still do very simple stuff. For example, an AND Gate sends an output of 1 if all of its inputs are 1,
				and a output of 0 otherwise. Combinations of logic gates finally form meaningful modules, say, for adding
				two numbers. Once you can add, you can also multiply, and once you can multiply, you can basically do anything. Since all
				basic operations are literally simpler than first grade math, you can imagine a computer as a group of 7-year-olds answering
				really basic math questions. A large enough bunch of them could compute anything from astrophysics to Zelda. However,
				with parts getting tinier and tinier, quantum physics are making things tricky. In a nutshell, a transistor is just an
				electric switch. Electricity is electrons moving from one place to another. So, a switch is a passage that can
				block electrons from moving in one direction. Today, a typical scale for transistors is 14 nanometers,
				which is about 8 times less than the HIV virus' diameter, and 500 times smaller than a red blood cell.
				As transistors are shrinking to the size of only a few atoms, electrons may just transfer themselves to
				the other side of a blocked passage via a process called Quantum Tunneling. In the quantum realm, physics
				works quite differently from the predictable ways we're used to, and traditional computers just stop making
				sense. We are approaching a real physical barrier for our technological progress. To solve this problem,
				scientists are trying to use these unusual quantum properties to their advantage by building quantum computers.
				In normal computers, bits are the smallest unit of information. Quantum computers use qubits which can also
				be set to one of two values. A qubit can be any two level quantum system, such as a spin and a magnetic
				field, or a single photon. 0 and 1 are this system's possible states, like the photons horizontal or
				vertical polarization. In the quantum world, the qubit doesn't have to be just one of those, it can be
				in any proportions of both states at once. This is called superposition. But as soon as you test its
				value, say, by sending the photon through a filter, it has to decide to be either vertically or
				horizontally polarized. So as long as it's unobserved, the qubit is in a superposition of probabilities
				for 0 and 1, and you can't predit which it'll be. But the instant you measure it, it collapses into one of
				the definite states. Superposition is a game changer. Four classical bits can be in one of two to the power of
				four different configurations at a time. That's 16 possible combinations, out of which you can use just one. Four
				qubits in superposition, however, can be in all of those 16 combinations at once. This number grows exponentially
				with each extra qubit. Twenty of them can already store a million values in parallel. A really weird and
				unintuitive property qubits can have is Entanglement, a close connection that makes each of the qubits react
				to a change in the other's state instantaneously, no matter how far they are apart. This means when measuring
				just one entangled qubit, you can directly deduce properties of it's partners without having to look. Qubit
				Manipulation is a mind bender as well. A normal logic gate gets a simple set of inputs
				and produces one definite output. A quantum gate manipulates an input of superpositions,
				rotates probabilities, and produces another superposition as its output. So a quantum
				computer sets up some qubits, applies quantum gates to entangle them and manipulate probabilities,
				then finally measures the outcome, collapsing superpositions to an actual sequence of 0s and 1s. What
				this means is that you get the entire lot of calculations that are possible with your setup, all
				done at the same time. Ultimately, you can only measure one of the results and it'll only probably
				be the one you want, so you may have to double check and try again. But by cleverly exploiting superposition
				and entanglement, this can be exponentially more efficient than would ever be possible on a normal computer.
				So, while quantum computers will not probably not replace our home computers, in some areas, they are vastly
				superior. One of them is database searching. To find something in a database, a normal computer may have to
				test every single one of its entries. Quantum computers algorithms need only the square root of that time,
				which for large databases, is a huge difference The most famous use of quantum computers is ruining IT security.
				Right now, your browsing, email, and banking data is being kept secure by an encryption system in which you
				give everyone a public key to encode messages only you can decode. The problem is that this public key
				can actually be used to calculate your secret private key. Luckily, doing the necessary math on any
				normal computer would literally take years of trial and error. But a quantum computer with exponential
				speed-up could do it in a breeze. Another really exciting new use is simulations. Simulations of the
				quantum world are very intense on resources, and even for bigger structures, such as molecules, they
				often lack accuracy. So why not simulate quantum physics with actual quantum physics? Quantum
				simulations could provide new insights on proteins that might revolutionize medicine. Right now,
				we don't know if quantum computers will be just a specallized tool, or a big revolution for humanity.
				We have no idea where the limits of technology are, and there's only one way to find out.
				You were on your way home when you died. It was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable,
				...but fatal nonetheless. It was a painless death. The medics tried their best to save you,
				...but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered, ...you were better off, trust me.
				And that's when you met me. "What happened?" "Where am I?" "You died," I said, matter-of-factly.
				No point in mincing words. "There was... there was a truck... ...and it was skidding." "Yes." "I..."
				"I... I died?" "Yes." "But don't feel bad about it." "Everyone dies." You looked around. There was
				nothingness. Just you and me. "What is this place?" "Is this the afterlife?" "More or less." "Are you God?"
				"Yes, I'm God." "My kids, my wife..." "What about them?" "Will they be all right?" "That's what I like to see,"
				I said, "You just died and your main concern is for your family. That's good stuff right there." You looked at
				me with fascination. To you, I didn't look like God. I just looked like some man or possibly a woman. Some
				vague authority figure, maybe. "Don't worry," I said, "They'll be fine." "Your kids will remember you as
				perfect in every way. They didn't have time to grow contemptuous of you. Your wife will cry on the outside,
				...but will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it's any consolation,
				...she'll feel very guilty for feeling relieved." "Oh... So, what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell
				or something?" "Neither, you'll be reincarnated." "Ah," "...so the Hindus were right." "All religions are
				right in their own way. Walk with me." You followed along as we strode through the void. "Where are we going?"
				"Nowhere in particular. It's just nice to walk while we talk." "So, what's the point then? When I get reborn,
				...I'll just be a blank slate, right? A baby. So, all my experiences and everything, ...everything I did in
				this life, won't matter?" "Not so. You have, within you, all the knowledge and experiences of all your past
				lives. You just don't remember them right now." I stopped walking and took you by the shoulders. "Your soul
				is more magnificent, beautiful and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a
				tiny fraction of what you are. It's like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it's hot or
				cold. You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, ...and when you bring it back out, ...you've gained
				all the experiences it had. You've been in a human for the last 48 years, ...so you haven't stretched out
				yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you'd
				start remembering everything. But there's no point to doing that between each life." "How many times
				have I been reincarnated then?" "Oh, lots. Lots and lots, ...and into lots of different lives. This
				time around, ...you'll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 A.D." "Wait, what?" You're sending me back in
				time?" "Well, I guess technically. Time as you know it only exists in your universe. Things are different
				where I come from." "Where... where you come from?" "Oh sure, I come from somewhere, somewhere else. And
				there are others like me. I know you'll want to know what it's like there, ...but honestly you wouldn't
				understand." "Oh..." you said, a little let down. "But wait. If I get reincarnated to other places in time,
				...I could have interacted with myself at some point." "Sure, happens all the time. And with both lives
				only aware of their own lifespan, ...you don't even know it's happening." "So, what's the point of it all?"
				I looked you in the eye. "The meaning of life, ...the reason I made this whole universe, ...is for you to
				mature." "You mean mankind, you want us to mature?" "No, just you. I made this whole universe for you.
				With each new life you grow and mature, ...and become a larger and greater intellect." "Just me? What
				about everyone else?" "There is no one else. In this universe, there's just you and me." You stared
				blankly at me. "But all the people on Earth?" "All you. Different incarnations of you." "Wait, I'm...
				...everyone?" "Now you're getting it." "I'm every human being who ever lived?" "Or who will ever live,
				yes." "I'm Abraham Lincoln?" "And you're John Wilkes Booth, too." "I'm Hitler?" ...you said, appalled.
				"And you're the millions he killed." "I'm Jesus?" "And you're everyone who followed him." You fell silent.
				"Every time you victimised someone, ...you were victimising yourself. Every act of kindness you've done,
				...you've done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human ...was or will be
				experienced by you." You thought for a long time. "Why? Why do all this?" "Because someday, you will
				become like me. Because that's what you are. You're one of my kind. You're my child!" "Wow!," you said,
				incredulous. "You mean, I'm a god!?" "No, not yet. You're a fetus, You're still growing. Once you've lived
				every human life throughout all time, ...you will have grown enough to be born." "So, the whole universe...
				It's just..." "An egg!", I answered. "Now it's time for you to move on to your next life." And I sent you on your way.
